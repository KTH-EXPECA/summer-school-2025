5G Latency Prediction with Mixture Density Networks

Part 1:

- Load EDAF measurements data
- Analyze:
  - Dataset's structure
  - Available information and insights

Model latency via unconditional density estimation
- Apply unconditional GMM and GMEVM approaches and compare
- Analyze the effect of:
  - Different number of samples
  - Normalization and Gaussian noise

Part 2:

Model latency with conditional density estimation
- Work out a conditional density estimation problem, based on the available data
- Apply conditional GMM and GMEVM approaches and compare
- Analyze the effect of:
  - Different number of training samples
  - Normalization, and standardization
